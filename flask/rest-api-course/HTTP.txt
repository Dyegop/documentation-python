HTTP NOTES:
    -METHODS:
        -GET     -> Request data from a specified resource
                 -> Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data)
                 -> Sending body/payload in a GET request is allowed, but it may cause the request to be rejected

        -POST    -> Send data to a server to modify and update a resource
                 -> The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent - calling it once or several times
                 successively has the same effect (no side effect), where successive identical POST may have additional
                 effects

        -PUT     -> Send data to a server to create a resource or overwrite it

        -HEAD    -> Request data from a specified resource without the response body
                 -> A response to a HEAD method should not have a body. If it has one anyway, that body must be ignored

        -DELETE  -> Delete the specified resource

        -OPTIONS -> Describe the communication options for the target resource

        -CONNECT -> Start two-way communications with the requested resource
                 -> It can be used to open a tunnel

        -TRACE   -> Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource, providing a useful debugging
                 mechanism

        -PATCH   -> Apply partial modifications to a resource
                 -> PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD
                 -> A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource


    -IMPORTANT NOTES:
        -Regarding the difference between PUT, POST or PATCH , who is deciding whether it is going to be a new resource
        creation or updating/modifying an existing one, it's the database operation or something equivalent to that
        which takes care of persistence.
        -So, you could use PUT, PATCH or POST indistinctly.


    -STATUS CODES:
        1xx - Informational response
            -100 -> Continue - the server has received the headers and the client should proceed to send body
        2xx - Success
            -200 -> OK
            -201 -> Created - the request has been fulfilled
            -202 -> Accepted - the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed
        4xx - Client errors
            -400 -> Bad Request
            -401 -> Unauthorized
            -403 -> Forbidden - Not having the necessary permissions or attempting a prohibited action
            -404 -> Not found - Requested resource could not be found
        5xx - Server errors
            -500 -> Internal Server Error
            -501 -> Not Implemented - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it can't to fulfil the request
            -502 -> Bad Gateway - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server
            -503 -> Service Unavailable - The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance)


    -QUERY STRINGS:
        -+ -> represent a space in query string
        -& -> separate the various var=value pairs in the query string


    -SESSIONES
        -Because HTTP is stateless, in order to associate a request to any other request, you need a way to store user
        data between HTTP requests.
        -Cookies or URL parameters (for ex. like http://example.com/myPage?asd=lol&boo=no) are both suitable ways to
        transport data between 2 or more request. However they are not good in case you don't want that data to be
        readable/editable on client side.
        -The solution is to store that data server side, give it an "id", and let the client only know (and pass back
        at every http request) that id. There you go, sessions implemented. Or you can use the client as a convenient
        remote storage, but you would encrypt the data and keep the secret server-side.
        -Of course there are other aspects to consider:
            *you don't want people to hijack other's sessions.
            *you want sessions to not last forever but to expire.
