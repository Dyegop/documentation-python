DJANGO NOTES:

When you install Django, it actually also installed a command line tool called django-admin.
Every django command follows this syntax: django-admin command
Every django project has the following structure:
    -urls.py     -> the URL patterns for your project
    -asgi.py     -> an entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project
    -wsgi.py     -> the Web Server Gateway Interface to help us deploy our web app to production
    -settings.py -> settings/configuration for a Django project
    -manage.py   -> command-line utility that lets you interact with a Django project in various ways






List of commands:
    -django-admin startproject project_name -> start a new project
