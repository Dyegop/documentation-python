    -Every django command follows this syntax: django-admin command


Project Structure:
    -urls.py     -> the URL patterns for your project
    -asgi.py     -> an entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project
    -wsgi.py     -> the Web Server Gateway Interface to help us deploy our web app to production
    -settings.py -> settings/configuration for a Django project
    -manage.py   -> command-line utility that lets you interact with a Django project in various ways
