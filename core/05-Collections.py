"""
COLLECTIONS
-Built-in module that implements specialized container data types.
-It provides alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers.

Counter():
-dictionary subclass which helps count hashable objects.
-Elements are stored as dictionary keys and the counts of the objects are stored as the value.

defaultdict():
-defaultdict is a dictionary-like object but takes a first argument (default_factory) as a
default data type.
-if a key is not found in the dictionary, instead of a KeyError being thrown, a new entry will be
created.
-Using defaultdict is faster than doing the same using dict.set_default() method.

OrderedDict():
-OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which its contents are added.

namedtuple():
-A namedtuple assigns names, as well as the numerical index, to each member.
-The difference with standard tuple is that they only use numerical indexes.
-Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, created by using the namedtuple()
factory function.
-The arguments are the name of the new class and a string containing the names of the elements.
