OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING NOTES

Concepts:
-Class: is a set of instructions for how to make an instance.
-Inheritance: attributes and methods from parent class can be used in child class.
-Attribute: variables that are accessible through instances.

Attributeâ€™s value can be changed in three ways:
-Changing the value directly through an instance.
-Setting the value through a method.
-Incrementing the value (add a certain amount to it) through a method.

Attributes can take parameters required when you create an object or can be defined to take a value.
    self.attribute = parameter --> attribute is linked to a parameter with an attribute for the object.
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    self.attribute = value --> we define a value for the attribute. For example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Dealer"

Self:
-Self is a reference to the instance itself.
-Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes self.
-It gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class
-Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class.

Inheritance:
-Parent class must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file.
-The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of a child class.
-Super() function is a special function that allows you to call a method from the parent class.
-Methods in the parent class can be overridden
