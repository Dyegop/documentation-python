BASIC CONCEPTS:
-Time-complexity: aka "Big O" or "Big Oh", it is the computational complexity that describes the
amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.
    -See https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity for information about time-complexity in
    every Python operation.
    -See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Table_of_common_time_complexities for
    general information.

-Hash table: a hash table is a structure that is designed to store a list of key-value pairs,
without compromising on speed and efficiency of manipulating and searching the structure.
    -The effectiveness of the hash table is derived from the hash function, a function that
    computes the index of the key-value pair.
    -In python, dictionaries and sets are implemented using a hash table.
    -Hash collisions are when two pieces of data in a hash table share the same hash value.
    -Hash collisions are practically unavoidable when hashing a random subset of a large set of
    possible keys.
    -Python uses open addressing to resolve hash coliisions.


PYTHON DATATYPES:
-Basic datatypes: int, float, string
-Basic containers: list, tuple, set, dictionary

STRINGS:
-Properties:
    -Immutable: elements cannot be changed or replaced.
    -Concatenation: strings can be concatenated using "+".
    -Indexing: access individual values.
    -Slicing: access a range of values
    -Strings can be iterated over, but are not iterable objects.

LISTS:
-Properties:
    -Mutable: their elements can be changed.
    -Concatenation: lists can be concatenated using "+".
    -Indexing: access individual values.
    -Slicing: access a range of values
    -Items are ordered and not unique.
    -Items can be of any kind, even lists, tuples, etc.

TUPLES:
-Properties:
    -Immutable: elements cannot be changed or replaced.
    -Concatenation: tuples can be concatenated using "+".
    -Indexing: access individual values.
    -Slicing: access a range of values
    -Items are ordered and not unique.
    -Items can be of any kind, even lists, tuples, etc.

SETS:
-Properties:
    -Mutable: their elements can be changed.
    -Items are unordered and unique.
    -Items in a set must be immutable, so we can't use lists, sets, dictionaries.
    -Duplicated items will not be presented.
    -Items can be of any kind, even lists, tuples, etc.

DICTIONARIES:
-Properties:
    -Mutable: their elements can be changed.
    -Items are unordered and not unique.
    -Values can be retrieved using keys that must be immutable (string, number, tuple with
    immutable elements) and unique.

# -----------------STRINGS-----------------

# Create a string
myString1 = ["text"]
myString2 = ['text']

# Indexing - my_string[n]
new_string1 = myString1[3]
new_string2 = myString1[-1]  # return the last character

# Slicing - my_string[start:stop:step]
# start - optional value, included (0 by default)
# stop  - mandatory value, not included (1 by default)
# step  - optional incremental value (1 by default)
new_string3 = myString1[1:3]  # return characters 1, 2

# String formatting with % Operator
# %s    -> character substitute for strings or any object with a string repr, like numbers
# %d    -> character substitute for integers
# %f    -> character substitute for floats, use %.<number of digits>f for a fixed amount
# %x/%X -> character substitute integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)
print('Hello %s' % 'Diego')
print('Hello %s, are you %d?' % ('Diego', 29))

# String formatting with format()
# Syntax -> 'String here {} then also {}'.format('something1','something2')
print('This is a string with an {}'.format('insert'))
print('The {2} {1} {0}'.format('fox', 'brown', 'quick'))
print('First Object: {a}, Second Object: {b}'.format(a=12.3, b='Two'))
print('A {p} saved is a {p} earned.'.format(p='penny'))

# String formatting with f-strings (since Python 3.6)
# Syntax -> f'String here {value:{width}.{precision}}'
name = 'Fred'
print(f"He said his name is {name}.")
