"""
GENERATORS:
-A generator is a function that remembers the state itâ€™s in, in between executions.
-Generators give us an easier way to create python iterators, using yield keyword instead of return.
-Generators are best for calculating large sets of results saving memory.

ITERATORS:
-Iterators are containers for objects so that you can loop over the objects.
-An iterable can be any object that has an __iter__ method defined. For example, lists are iterators.

# iter() -> create an object which can be iterated one element at a time. Useful to iterate over strings
