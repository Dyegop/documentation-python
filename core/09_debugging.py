"""
ERROR HANDLING:
-Errors can be handled with try and except statements.
    -Try: the code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause.
    -Except: the program execution executes the code inside except clause if an error happens.
    -Finally: the code that runs whether an exception happens or not.
    -Else: the code that runs if an exception is not raise.
-There are a lot of different exceptions.

RAISING EXCEPTIONS:
-Raise keyword allows you to raise your own exceptions.
-If no expressions are present, raise re-raises the last exception that was active in the current
scope further up the call stack.
-A raise statement must include the following elements:
    -The raise keyword.
    -A call to the Exception() function.
    -A string with a helpful error message passed to the Exception() function.

ASSERTIONS:
-Assertions helps to detect problems early in your program, where the cause is clear.
-The program to test a condition, and immediately trigger an error if the condition is false.
-The syntax will be -> assert condition.
-If an assert fails, your program should crash.

LOGGING:
-Pythonâ€™s logging module makes it easy to create a record of custom messages that you write.
-These log messages will describe when the program execution has reached the logging function.
call and list any variables you have specified at that point in time.

# logging.debug()    -> logs a DEBUG msg. Used for small details.
# logging.info()     -> logs a INFO msg. Used to record information on general event
# logging.warning()  -> logs a WARNING msg. Used to indicate a problem but the program still works
# logging.error()    -> logs a ERROR msg. Used to record an error that caused the program to fail
# logging.critical() -> logs a CRITICAL msg. Used to indicate a fatal error
